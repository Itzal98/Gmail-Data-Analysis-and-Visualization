# **Gmail Data Analysis and Visualization**
**Web scraping, cleaning and transforming the email data from my personal Gmail account with Python and Power BI.**

This project consists of cleaning, manipulating and transforming data from my personal gmail account emails that were extracted using web scraping tools. Then some visual elements were created using PowerBI, trying to capture some key figures such as the number of emails per year, month, day of the week and time. We also added a word cloud to identify the most common topics in the emails received.

Pd: My personal email does not contain many emails because during these years I have mostly used my institutional email, but this was not an obstacle to carry out this project that I wanted to elaborate with great enthusiasm.
